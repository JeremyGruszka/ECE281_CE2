#### Analysis
After completing both the structural and behavioral decoders and their respective testbenches, it can be seen that the both the structural and behavioral decoders effectively create the same output, showing that they have the same functionality.  When looking at the 2 waveforms section by section, with every 100 ns consisting of a section, the line readings from both waveforms are exactly the same at every point in time.  This means that the two types of decoders they are simulating have the same functionality.

In regards to the question posed in step 15, the definition of a decoder is "an electronic device that changes signals for a radio, television, etc., to a form that can be heard or seen correctly" (Merriam-Webster dictionary).  According to our textbook, "A decoder has N inputs and 2^N outputs.  It asserts exactly one of the outputs depending on the input combination."  When it comes to memory, decoders become very useful to computers.  Memory decoders can usually address a memory space that is much larger than the memory space covered by an individual memory chip. This allows items to be saved to memory that would normally be too large to be saved.
